    <h1>Dresden</h1>
    <h2>Quick facts</h2>
    <p><i><strong>Dresden, capital of the eastern German state of Saxony,</strong></i> is distinguished by the celebrated art museums and
        classic architecture of its reconstructed old town. Completed in 1743 and rebuilt after WWII, the baroque church
        Frauenkirche is famed for its grand dome. The Versailles-inspired Zwinger palace houses museums including
        Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, exhibiting masterpieces of art like Raphael’s “Sistine Madonna.”</p>

    <h2>Dresden sightseeing</h2>
    <p><strong>Dresden Frauenkirche</strong> is one of the most remarkable reconstruction projects ever to have taken
        place in Germany, if not the world. Completed in 1743, the spectacular Baroque original was considered one of
        the most beautiful churches in Europe. After its destruction during Allied bombing in 1945, the ruins of the old
        building were catalogued and stored for use in its reconstruction.

    <p><strong>Dresden Royal Palace and Museums. </strong>If you have time to see nothing else in Dresden, it should be
        this and the Frauenkirche. One of Europe's richest and probably its oldest public museum (although the Vatican
        disputes this), the <i>Dresden State Art Collection</i>, inside the <i>Dresden Royal Palace</i>, is also one of
        its most
        modern and forward-looking in terms of displaying and interpreting its treasures for visitors.

        <strong>Zwinger and Old Masters Picture Gallery. </strong>The Zwinger - a magnificent early 18th-century palace
        in the center of the city beside the Elbe - is one of the finest examples of Baroque architecture in Germany.
        It's worth walking around the outside just to appreciate its architecture. On its south side is the majestic
        32-bayed Long Gallery, and flanking it to the east and west are four symmetrically arranged pavilions, the
        Wallpavillon and the Nymphenbad (Bath of the Nymphs), with its graceful fountains and mythological figures.

        <strong>Semper Opera and Theaterplatz. </strong>The west side of Dresden's Theaterplatz, one of Germany's finest
        public squares, is dominated by the magnificent Semperoper, the city's opera house, built in the style of the
        Italian High Renaissance. To see the lavishly decorated interior, either attend a performance (which include
        concerts, ballet, and opera) or take a spirited tour led by one of the staff, who will share tales of some of
        the great performers and guests as you tour.

        In the center of Theaterplatz stands an equestrian statue from 1883 of King John, and at the southeast corner
        stands the Altstädter Wache, the <i>Old Town Guard-House</i>, built in 1831 and modeled on the famous Guardhouse
        in
        Berlin. To the southeast is the <i>Taschenbergpalais</i>, a Baroque palace dating from 1711.

    <h2>Twin towns – sister cities</h2>
    <p>Dresden and Coventry became twins after the Second World War in an act of reconciliation, as both had suffered
        near-total destruction from massive aerial bombing.[70] Similar symbolism occurred in 1988, when Dresden twinned
        with the Dutch city of Rotterdam. The Coventry Blitz and Rotterdam Blitz bombardments by the German Luftwaffe
        are also considered to be disproportional.

        Dresden has had a triangular partnership with Saint Petersburg and Hamburg since 1987. <i><u><strong>Dresden is twinned with:</strong></u></i>
    <ul>
        <li>Coventry, England, United Kingdom (1959)</li>
        <li>Saint Petersburg, Russia (1961)</li>
        <li>Wrocław, Poland (1963)</li>
        <li>Skopje, North Macedonia (1967)</li>
        <li>Ostrava, Czech Republic (1971</li>
    </ul>
